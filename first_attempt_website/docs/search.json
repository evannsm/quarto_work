I find that if I write to explain to others I force myself to understand things more deeply. I also hope to cover things I wish had been explained to me in a particular manner, or just things I find interesting that are (maybe even just tangentially) related to my field."

I have been developing a toolbox called immrax, which we have used to scalably certify safe performance of neural networks in safety-critical control systems, and train neural networks with robust safety guarantees outright. I am also interested in more mathematical tools such as contraction theory and differential geometry, and how they factor into modern control systems analysis."
