# Welcome to My Research Site!

egm \[at\] gatech.edu

I am a Robotics/ECE Ph.D student in the Formal Methods & Autonomous Control of Transportation Systems ([FACTS](https://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/)) Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of Dr. Samuel Coogan.

My research is centered around safe autonomy of hardware systems, primarily focusing on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and some unammed ground vehicles as well (UGVs). In particular, I work on safe and efficient path planning and control synthesis, often in the face of computational limitations on the hardware end.

I hope to walk the tightrope between theory and hardware implementation as seamlessly as possible and make contributions on both ends throughout my career.
