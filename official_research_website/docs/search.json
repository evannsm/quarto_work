In particular, I work on safe and efficient path planning and control synthesis, often in the face of computational limitations on the hardware end.\nI hope to walk the tightrope between theory and hardware implementation as seamlessly as possible and make contributions on both ends throughout my career.\n\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology| Atlanta, GA\nPhD in Robotics | Aug 2022 - Present\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington | Arlington, TX\nHonors B.S in Electrical Engineering | Aug 2018 - May 2022\nMinors in Mathematics and Physics Summa Cum Laude"
