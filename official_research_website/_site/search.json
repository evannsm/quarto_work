I have been developing a toolbox called immrax, which we have used to scalably certify safe performance of neural networks in safety-critical control systems, and train neural networks with robust safety guarantees outright. I am also interested in more mathematical tools such as contraction theory and differential geometry, and how they factor into modern control systems analysis."
